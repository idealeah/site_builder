### Felt Board
3 groups have felt sheets, a white base sheet, and scissors
3 groups have markers and a sheet of paper

## Introduction
Depict a car, using only the materials on the table. Include at least one other element in the scene, maybe a tree, or a person, or a cat.

Consider the elements that make up an image of a car: wheels, doors, windows. Your groups will each make one scene, so share paper, markers, felt and scissors.

##Create Cars: 10m

## Discussion
Each group share their scene.
What are the benefits to creating the scene from felt?
What are the benefits to creating the scene with paper and markers?

What are the drawbacks to each?
What qualities emerge from the two approaches?

Now, pretend that your scene is part of an animation. You‚Äôd need to create the next frame. With your group, discuss how you‚Äôd move the car forward, or re-position other scene elements.
How would you move the scene forward?

| 1     | Alyssa, Carla, Dahee <br/> Choose a work that was **very clearly** made using turtle graphics.                      |
| 2     | Max, Aakanksha, Patricia <br/> Choose a work that uses turtle graphics, but doesn't look "turtley".                 |
| 3     | Sue, Julian, Madison  <br/> Choose a work that is well "framed".                                                    |
| 4     | Earl, Ting, Bella <br/> This week several sketches used dense lines to create form. Choose one of these to discuss. |
| 5     | Patrick, Leah, Mario <br/> Choose your favorite challenge response. Discuss.                                        |
| 6     | Jack, Rik, Kirsten <br/> Which work got the most üòÇ + üòç + ü§ì. Discuss.                                             |
